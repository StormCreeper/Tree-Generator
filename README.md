# Tree Generator
This program is made using c++ and OpenGL. It is mimicking fractal patterns using recursion.
It has been entirely made during the Tech with Tim code jam.

## Usage
There is a sln file for compiling with visual studio, but you can compile with the compiler you want (you may have to change the code depending on your compiler).
You will have to link :
-[GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html)
